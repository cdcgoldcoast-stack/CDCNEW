## Goal: Get Renovation Clients on the Gold Coast

---

## 🎯 The Strategy

### What Makes CDC Different (Your Angle)
- **Design-led approach** - Not just builders, designers who build
- **Since 2000** - 25+ years experience
- **Local Gold Coast team** - Based in Broadbeach, know the area
- **QBCC Licensed & Master Builders** - Proper credentials
- **AI Design Tool** - Unique tech advantage

### Voice & Tone
- Professional but approachable
- "We" not "I" (team-based)
- Confident but not arrogant
- Local pride (Gold Coast specific)
- Human - talk like you'd talk to a client in person

## 📍 PRIORITY 1: Suburb Landing Pages

### Why These Matter
People search "kitchen renovations Burleigh Heads" not "Gold Coast kitchen renovations"

### High-Priority Suburbs (Create These First)

1. **Burleigh Heads** - Affluent, design-conscious
2. **Broadbeach** - Your home turf, high-rise apartments
3. **Mermaid Beach** - Premium, older homes needing renovation
4. **Robina** - Family homes, good volume
5. **Palm Beach** - Coastal renovations
6. **Elanora** - Established homes, families
7. **Helensvale** - Growing area, families
8. **Hope Island** - Premium waterfront
9. **Southport** - Mixed demographics, volume
10. **Currumbin** - Coastal character homes

### Page Template for Each Suburb

```
URL: /renovations/[suburb-name]
Title: [Suburb] Renovations | Kitchen, Bathroom & Home | CDC

Structure:
1. Hero: "Renovation Builders in [Suburb]" + local image
2. Intro paragraph (150 words) - mention specific local character
3. Services offered in this suburb
4. Why locals choose CDC
5. Nearby project example
6. Local FAQs (3-5)
7. CTA section

Word count target: 600-800 words per page
```

### Example Content - Burleigh Heads

```
Burleigh Heads has a unique character - those leafy streets, the mix of 
original beach shacks and modern architecture, the way the afternoon light 
hits the hillside homes. We've been renovating in Burleigh since 2005, and 
we understand what makes these homes special.

The challenge with Burleigh renovations? Many of these homes were built 
in the 70s and 80s with layouts that don't match how we live now. Closed-off 
kitchens. Small bathrooms. No indoor-outdoor flow. But the location is 
irreplaceable - so you renovate instead of moving.

We recently completed a whole-home renovation on Fourth Avenue (you can 
see it in our projects). The owners wanted to keep that relaxed Burleigh 
vibe while opening up the living spaces. We removed walls, added bifolds 
out to the deck, and used natural materials that fit the coastal setting.

Common Burleigh renovation requests:
- Opening up 70s/80s brick homes
- Coastal kitchen renovations
- Adding decks/outdoor kitchens
- Updating bathrooms with natural stone
- Full character home renovations
```

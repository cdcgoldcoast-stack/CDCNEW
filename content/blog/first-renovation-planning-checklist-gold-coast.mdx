Your first renovation can feel overwhelming. With so many decisions to make and dollars at stake, having a clear roadmap transforms anxiety into confidence. This comprehensive checklist guides Gold Coast homeowners through the essential planning stages.

> **Who This Guide Is For:** Homeowners planning their first significant renovation—whether that's a kitchen refresh, bathroom update, or whole-home transformation on the Gold Coast.

## Phase 1: Define Your Renovation Outcomes

Before selecting tiles or talking to builders, clarity on what you're trying to achieve guides every subsequent decision.

### Document Current Pain Points

Walk through your home and identify specific problems:

- **Functionality Issues:** Not enough storage? Poor kitchen workflow? Single bathroom for a family?
- **Aesthetic Concerns:** Outdated finishes? Mismatched styles from previous updates?
- **Condition Problems:** Water damage? Termite damage? Failing waterproofing?
- **Efficiency Gaps:** Poor insulation? Single-glazed windows? Old appliances?

### Establish Success Criteria

For each space being renovated, define what "done well" looks like:

- **Kitchen:** "Cook without bumping into family, with enough bench space for meal prep"
- **Bathroom:** "A shower that doesn't leak, storage for all toiletries, calming aesthetic"
- **Living areas:** "Seamless indoor-outdoor flow for entertaining"

> **Quick Tip:** Collect images that represent your vision—Pinterest boards, magazine cuttings, or photos from our [renovation gallery](/renovation-gallery). Visual references communicate preferences more effectively than words alone.

### Determine Scope Boundaries

Be clear about what's included and excluded:

| Included | Maybe | Excluded |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Kitchen cabinetry & appliances | Flooring in adjacent rooms | Bedrooms |
| Bathroom fixtures & tiling | Lighting upgrades elsewhere | Exterior painting |
| Structural walls (if needed)| Window replacements | Landscaping |

## Phase 2: Establish Your Budget Framework

Gold Coast renovation costs vary based on scope, finishes, and existing conditions.

### Understand Cost Categories

A practical renovation budget splits into clear categories:

**Construction Costs (50-60% of budget)**
- Demolition and site preparation
- Structural works
- Trade labour (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, tilers)
- Core materials (framing, plaster, waterproofing)

**Selections and Finishes (30-40% of budget)**
- Cabinetry and joinery
- Tiles and flooring
- Tapware and fixtures
- Benchtops and splashbacks
- Lighting and electrical accessories

**Contingency (10-15% of budget)**
- Unknown conditions discovered during demolition
- Variations requested during construction

### Gold Coast Market Rates (2026)

| Project Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Kitchen refresh | $25,000 - $45,000 | Cabinetry refacing, benchtop, appliances |
| Full kitchen renovation | $45,000 - $85,000+ | Complete strip-out, custom cabinetry |
| Bathroom renovation | $25,000 - $50,000 | Standard layout, quality fixtures |
| Luxury bathroom | $50,000 - $90,000+ | Large format tiles, freestanding bath |
| Whole home renovation | $150,000 - $400,000+ | Multiple rooms, structural changes |

> **Warning:** Quotes significantly below market rates often indicate incomplete scope, inexperienced operators, or planned variations. Always verify QBCC licensing.

## Phase 3: Navigate Approvals and Compliance

Gold Coast projects may require various approvals.

### Determine Approval Requirements

| Work Type | Approval Needed | Timeline |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Internal renovations (no structural) | Exempt or certifier | 2-5 days |
| Structural wall removal | Building certifier | 2-4 weeks |
| Extensions or additions | Council DA or CDC | 4-12 weeks |
| Work on character homes | Council approval | 6-16 weeks |

> **Quick Tip:** Order a copy of your property's **Survey Plan** and **Building Records** early. These reveal easements, previous approvals, and structural information.

## Phase 4: Select Your Project Team

### Decide on Delivery Method

**Design + Build (Integrated)**
- Single contract for design and construction
- Streamlined communication
- Clear accountability

**Architect/Designer + Builder (Separated)**
- Independent design documentation
- Competitive tender to multiple builders
- More control over selections

### Evaluate Builders

**Critical Checks:**

1. **Verify QBCC License:** Check status at qbcc.qld.gov.au
2. **Request Recent References:** Speak to 2-3 recent clients
3. **Review Insurance:** Public liability ($10M+) and home warranty insurance
4. **Inspect Completed Work:** Visit finished projects
5. **Understand Communication:** Clear, regular updates prevent stress

## Phase 5: Finalise Selections Before Construction

### Prioritise Long-Lead Items

Order these **8-10 weeks** before construction:

1. Custom cabinetry (6-8 weeks)
2. Imported fixtures (8-12 weeks)
3. Specialty tiles (4-6 weeks)
4. Windows and doors (6-10 weeks)
5. Appliances (2-6 weeks)

> **The 48-Hour Rule:** Respond to builder questions within 48 hours. Delays in selections cascade through the entire project schedule.

## Phase 6: Prepare for Construction

### Practical Arrangements

- **Alternative facilities:** Set up temporary kitchen or bathroom
- **Storage:** Clear belongings from work areas
- **Access:** Provide keys, establish pet protocols
- **Neighbours:** Notify adjoining properties

### Establish Communication Rhythms

- Weekly site meetings or progress reports
- Preferred contact method for urgent questions
- Document storage (contracts, variations, selections)

## Phase 7: Manage the Build

### Key Inspection Points

Be present or request photos at these stages:

1. **Post-demolition:** Assess hidden conditions
2. **Pre-waterproofing:** Verify substrate preparation
3. **Post-waterproofing:** Review membrane application
4. **Pre-painting:** Check tiling and joinery quality
5. **Practical completion:** Detailed defect inspection

## Common First-Timer Mistakes to Avoid

- **Underestimating Budget:** Insufficient contingency causes stress
- **Prioritising Trends Over Function:** Does it make the space work better?
- **Choosing Cheapest Quote:** Value matters more than price
- **Neglecting Storage:** Beautiful spaces become frustrating without it
- **Micromanaging Trades:** Daily interference slows progress

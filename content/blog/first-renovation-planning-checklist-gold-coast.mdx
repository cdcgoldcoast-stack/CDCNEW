## Take a Deep Breath

Your first renovation can feel overwhelming. But here's the truth: thousands of Gold Coast families go through this every year, and most of them come out the other side with homes they love.

Here's how to start without the stress.

## Step 1: Know What You're Solving

Before you pick a single tile, get clear on what's not working now.

- Is it storage? Space? Light?
- Do you need better flow for family life?
- Are you fixing problems or chasing a style?

Write it down. This list becomes your compass when decisions get hard.

## Step 2: Set a Realistic Budget

Be honest about what you can spend. Then add a buffer—10-15% for the things you can't predict.

**The golden rule:** Don't max out your budget on the build. You'll want some left over for curtains, furniture, and all the little things that make a house feel like home.

## Step 3: Find the Right Builder

This is the most important decision you'll make. Not the tiles. Not the kitchen handles. The person running the project.

Look for:
- **QBCC license** (non-negotiable)
- **Recent local work** you can visit
- **Clear communication** from the first meeting
- **A team that listens** more than they talk

Trust your gut. You'll be working closely with these people for weeks.

## Step 4: Make Big Decisions Early

The best way to avoid delays? Decide before demolition starts.

- Tiles
- Fixtures
- Cabinetry style
- Appliances

Late changes cost time and money. Early decisions keep everything moving.

## Step 5: Prepare for Disruption

Living through a renovation is dusty, noisy, and occasionally chaotic. But it's also exciting.

Set up:
- A temporary kitchen (espresso machine essential)
- Alternative bathroom arrangements if needed
- A "reno-free" zone where you can escape the chaos

## Common First-Timer Mistakes

**Rushing the design:** Good planning pays off for years. Hasty decisions show up as regrets.

**Chasing trends:** Classic and functional beats trendy every time.

**Micromanaging:** You hired experts—let them do their job.

**Forgetting the details:** Power points, lighting switches, storage for specific items you own.

## The Mindset Shift

Think of your builder as a partner, not just a contractor. The best results come from collaboration, not combat.

Ask questions. Share concerns. But also trust the process.

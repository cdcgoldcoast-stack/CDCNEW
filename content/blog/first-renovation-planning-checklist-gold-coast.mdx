</Callout>

## Phase 1: Define Your Renovation Outcomes

Before selecting tiles or talking to builders, clarity on what you're trying to achieve guides every subsequent decision.

### 1.1 Document Current Pain Points

Walk through your home with a notepad and identify specific problems:

<Checklist items={[
  {
    title: "Functionality Issues",
    description: "Not enough storage? Poor kitchen workflow? Single bathroom for a family of four?",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    title: "Aesthetic Concerns",
    description: "Outdated finishes? Mismatched styles from previous partial updates?",
    priority: "medium"
  },
  {
    title: "Condition Problems",
    description: "Water damage? Termite damage? Failing waterproofing? Structural cracks?",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    title: "Efficiency Gaps",
    description: "Poor insulation? Single-glazed windows? Old appliances with high running costs?",
    priority: "medium"
  }
]} />

### 1.2 Establish Success Criteria

For each space being renovated, define what "done well" looks like:

- **Kitchen:** "I want to cook without bumping into family members, with enough bench space for meal prep"
- **Bathroom:** "I want a shower that doesn't leak, storage for all toiletries, and a calming aesthetic"
- **Living areas:** "I want seamless indoor-outdoor flow for entertaining"

<QuickTip>
Collect images that represent your vision—Pinterest boards, magazine cuttings, or photos from our [renovation gallery](/renovation-gallery). Visual references communicate your preferences more effectively than words alone.
</QuickTip>

### 1.3 Determine Scope Boundaries

Be clear about what's included and excluded:

| Included | Maybe | Excluded |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Kitchen cabinetry & appliances | Flooring in adjacent rooms | Bedrooms |
| Bathroom fixtures & tiling | Lighting upgrades elsewhere | Exterior painting |
| Structural walls (if needed)| Window replacements | Landscaping |

## Phase 2: Establish Your Budget Framework

Gold Coast renovation costs vary significantly based on scope, finishes, and existing conditions. Here's how to approach budgeting realistically.

### 2.1 Understand Cost Categories

A practical renovation budget splits into clear categories:

**Construction Costs (50-60% of budget)**
- Demolition and site preparation
- Structural works
- Trade labour (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, tilers)
- Core materials (framing, plaster, waterproofing)

**Selections and Finishes (30-40% of budget)**
- Cabinetry and joinery
- Tiles and flooring
- Tapware and fixtures
- Benchtops and splashbacks
- Lighting and electrical accessories
- Paint and decorative finishes

**Contingency (10-15% of budget)**
- Unknown conditions discovered during demolition
- Variations requested during construction
- Market price fluctuations

### 2.2 Research Gold Coast Market Rates

For 2026, expect these approximate ranges for quality renovations:

| Project Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Kitchen refresh | $25,000 - $45,000 | Cabinetry refacing, benchtop replacement, appliance upgrade |
| Full kitchen renovation | $45,000 - $85,000+ | Complete strip-out, custom cabinetry, premium finishes |
| Bathroom renovation | $25,000 - $50,000 | Standard layout, quality fixtures, tiled finishes |
| Luxury bathroom | $50,000 - $90,000+ | Large format tiles, freestanding bath, custom vanity |
| Whole home renovation | $150,000 - $400,000+ | Multiple rooms, structural changes, high-end finishes |

<Callout type="warning" title="Beware Low Quotes">
Quotes significantly below market rates often indicate: incomplete scope, inexperienced operators, or planned variations once work begins. Always verify QBCC licensing and request references.
</Callout>

### 2.3 Secure Financing

If required, arrange finance before engaging builders:

- **Home equity loans:** Typically lowest rates, using existing property equity
- **Construction loans:** Progress payment structures aligned with build stages
- **Personal loans:** Faster approval but higher interest rates
- **Savings:** No interest costs, but ensure sufficient buffer for contingencies

## Phase 3: Navigate Approvals and Compliance

Gold Coast renovation projects may require various approvals depending on scope.

### 3.1 Determine Approval Requirements

| Work Type | Approval Needed | Typical Timeline |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Internal renovations (no structural) | Exempt or building certifier | 2-5 days |
| Structural wall removal | Building certifier or council | 2-4 weeks |
| Extensions or additions | Council DA or CDC | 4-12 weeks |
| Work on character homes | Council approval | 6-16 weeks |
| Plumbing/drainage changes | QBCC licensed plumber | Part of build |
| Electrical upgrades | QBCC licensed electrician | Part of build |

### 3.2 Check for Constraints

Research any restrictions on your property:

- **Heritage listings:** Character overlay restrictions
- **Body corporate rules:** Unit/townhouse renovation approvals
- **Easements:** Utility access restrictions
- **Setbacks:** Minimum distances from boundaries
- **Height limits:** Especially relevant for second-storey additions

<QuickTip>
Order a copy of your property's **Survey Plan** (from Queensland Globe or surveyor) and **Building Records** (from Gold Coast City Council) early. These reveal easements, previous approvals, and structural information.
</QuickTip>

## Phase 4: Select Your Project Team

### 4.1 Decide on Delivery Method

**Design + Build (Integrated)**
- Single contract for design and construction
- Streamlined communication
- Clear accountability
- Best for: Busy homeowners wanting simplified process

**Architect/Designer + Builder (Separated)**
- Independent design documentation
- Competitive tender to multiple builders
- More control over selections
- Best for: Complex projects, specific design requirements

### 4.2 Evaluate Builders

The QBCC license check is essential, but dig deeper:

<Checklist items={[
  {
    title: "Verify QBCC License",
    description: "Check license status at qbcc.qld.gov.au—must be current for structural work",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    title: "Request Recent References",
    description: "Speak to 2-3 recent clients about communication, timeline, and quality",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    title: "Review Insurance Coverage",
    description: "Public liability ($10M+) and home warranty insurance for work over $3,300",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    title: "Inspect Completed Work",
    description: "Visit finished projects to assess quality of finishes and detailing",
    priority: "medium"
  },
  {
    title: "Understand Communication Style",
    description: "Clear, regular updates prevent misunderstandings and stress",
    priority: "medium"
  }
]} />

### 4.3 Request Detailed Quotes

Compare quotes on equal scope:

- Ensure identical inclusions (don't compare basic with premium)
- Check for provisional sum (PS) items—allowances that may increase
- Understand payment terms and schedule
- Clarify variation processes

## Phase 5: Finalise Selections Before Construction

### 5.1 Prioritise Long-Lead Items

Order these items **8-10 weeks** before construction:

1. **Custom cabinetry** (6-8 week manufacturing)
2. **Imported fixtures** (8-12 week shipping)
3. **Specialty tiles** (4-6 weeks if not in stock)
4. **Windows and doors** (6-10 weeks manufacturing)
5. **Appliances** (2-6 weeks depending on brand)

### 5.2 Create Selection Schedule

Document all choices in one place:

| Item | Product | Supplier | Cost | Ordered | Delivery |
|------|---------|----------|------|---------|----------|
| Kitchen tiles | 600x600 porcelain | [Supplier] | $X | Date | Date |
| Vanity | Custom 1200mm | [Cabinetmaker] | $X | Date | Date |
| Shower mixer | Brand/Model | [Supplier] | $X | Date | Date |

<Callout type="tip" title="The 48-Hour Rule">
Set a goal to respond to builder questions within 48 hours. Delays in selections decisions cascade through the entire project schedule.
</Callout>

## Phase 6: Prepare for Construction

### 6.1 Practical Arrangements

- **Alternative facilities:** Set up temporary kitchen or bathroom arrangements
- **Storage:** Clear belongings from work areas
- **Access:** Provide keys or access codes, establish pet protocols
- **Neighbours:** Notify adjoining properties of upcoming work

### 6.2 Protect Your Home

- Dust barriers to unaffected areas
- Floor protection through access routes
- Secure storage for valuable items
- Relocate vehicles during heavy delivery days

### 6.3 Establish Communication Rhythms

- Weekly site meetings or progress reports
- Preferred contact method for urgent questions
- Document storage (contracts, variations, selections)

## Phase 7: Manage the Build

### 7.1 Key Inspection Points

Be present or request photos at these critical stages:

1. **Post-demolition:** Assess hidden conditions before proceeding
2. **Pre-waterproofing:** Verify substrate preparation
3. **Post-waterproofing:** Review membrane application before tiling
4. **Pre-painting:** Check tiling and joinery quality
5. **Practical completion:** Detailed defect inspection

### 7.2 Handle Variations Professionally

Changes during construction happen, but manage them properly:

- Request written variation quotes before approving
- Understand timeline impacts
- Update contract documentation
- Maintain variation register

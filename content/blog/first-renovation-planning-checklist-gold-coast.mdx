Starting a renovation is easier when the decisions happen in the right order. This checklist is designed for families planning kitchens, bathrooms, or full-home upgrades on the Gold Coast.

## 1. Lock the renovation outcomes first

Write down what you want to improve in daily life:

- better kitchen flow
- easier bathroom cleaning
- more storage
- stronger indoor and outdoor connection

If your goals are still broad, start with a scope conversation via our [renovation consultation page](/book-renovation-consultation).

## 2. Set a realistic budget range

Budgets perform better when split into three buckets:

1. required building work
2. selections and finishes
3. contingency for unknowns

For reference examples, browse completed [renovation projects](/renovation-projects) before finalizing your range.

## 3. Confirm site and approval constraints

Before design details are locked, verify:

- structural changes
- service relocations
- approval requirements
- access constraints

This step protects your schedule and helps avoid redesign loops mid-project.

## 4. Prioritize decisions that affect lead times

Selections with longer procurement windows should be chosen early:

- appliances
- custom cabinetry
- plumbing fixtures
- specialist finishes

Keeping these decisions ahead of demolition keeps the construction sequence clean.

## 5. Stage communication milestones

Set weekly check-ins and agree on who signs off each milestone. A clear sign-off process reduces scope drift and protects delivery quality.

When you are ready, we can map the next steps with you and translate this checklist into a project-specific plan.

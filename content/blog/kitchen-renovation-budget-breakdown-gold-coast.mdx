Planning a kitchen renovation budget feels like solving a puzzle with moving pieces. Without a clear framework, costs spiral and trade-offs become stressful. This guide provides realistic Gold Coast pricing, category-based budgeting, and practical strategies.

> **2026 Gold Coast Market:** Pricing reflects current market conditions. Materials, labour availability, and demand fluctuations affect final costs.

## Three Critical Budget Mistakes

### 1. Finalising Layout Without Checking Services

Moving a sink 2 metres requires new drainage runs, possible concrete cutting, and water extensions.

**Cost impact:** $2,000 - $8,000 if discovered after demolition

**Solution:** Have a plumber inspect existing services before finalising design.

### 2. Approving Premium Finishes Before Confirming Base Scope

Selecting expensive marble before confirming structural works can derail budgets.

**Solution:** Lock structural scope before selecting finishes.

### 3. Running With No Contingency Buffer

**Common surprises:**
- Water damage in kickboards
- Termite damage in framing
- Asbestos in old backing boards
- Outdated wiring requiring full upgrade

**Solution:** Maintain 10-15% contingency.

## Smart Money-Saving Strategies

- **Keep the Layout:** Maintaining sink, stove, and fridge positions saves thousands
- **Standard Sizes:** Use standard 600mm, 900mm cabinet modules where possible
- **Mix Materials:** Premium stone on island, standard on laundry nearby
- **Phased Approach:** Complete structural work now, upgrade appliances later

## When to Invest More

**Worth the Premium:**
- Quality hardware (soft-close drawers)
- Task lighting (under-cabinet LED)
- Stone benchtops (durability)
- Quality tapware (daily use item)

**Consider Carefully:**
- Statement rangehoods
- Super-premium appliances
- Exotic stone requiring maintenance

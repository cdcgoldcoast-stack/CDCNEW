Planning a kitchen renovation budget feels like solving a puzzle with moving pieces. Without a clear framework, costs spiral and trade-offs become stressful. This guide provides realistic Gold Coast pricing, category-based budgeting, and practical strategies to maximise value from your investment.

Pricing reflects current Gold Coast market conditions. Materials, labour availability, and demand fluctuations affect final costs. Use these figures as planning guides, not fixed quotes.

## Understanding Kitchen Renovation Costs

Kitchen renovations on the Gold Coast typically range from **$35,000 for a standard refresh** to **$100,000+ for a luxury transformation**. The final figure depends on size, layout changes, materials, and appliance selections.

### Cost Per Square Metre Framework

| Kitchen Size | Standard ($/m²) | Premium ($/m²) | Luxury ($/m²) |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Small (6-10m²) | $4,000 - $5,500 | $6,000 - $8,000 | $9,000+ |
| Medium (10-15m²) | $3,500 - $5,000 | $5,500 - $7,500 | $8,500+ |
| Large (15-20m²+) | $3,000 - $4,500 | $5,000 - $7,000 | $8,000+ |

*Larger kitchens often have lower per-square-metre costs due to fixed costs being spread across more area.*

## Detailed Budget Breakdown

### 1. Cabinetry & Joinery (35-40% of budget)

Cabinetry typically consumes the largest portion of your kitchen budget—it's the visual foundation and functional engine of the space.

**Standard Range: $12,000 - $25,000**
- Melamine or laminate doors
- Standard hardware
- Basic internal fittings
- Limited custom elements

**Premium Range: $25,000 - $45,000**
- Polyurethane painted doors or timber veneer
- Soft-close hardware throughout
- Pull-out pantries and drawer systems
- Some custom features

**Luxury Range: $45,000 - $80,000+**
- Two-pack polyurethane or solid timber
- Premium European hardware (Blum, Hettich)
- Fully customised internal organisation
- Integrated appliance panels
- Feature island with specialised detailing

<QuickTip>
Cabinetry costs scale with door style complexity. Flat-panel doors are most economical; shaker-style and detailed profiles require more labour and materials.
</QuickTip>

### 2. Benchtops (10-15% of budget)

Your benchtop choice significantly impacts both aesthetics and functionality.

| Material | Price Range (per m² installed) | Characteristics |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Laminate | $150 - $400 | Budget-friendly, many colours, less durable |
| Engineered Stone | $600 - $1,200 | Most popular, non-porous, consistent patterns |
| Granite | $700 - $1,500 | Natural variation, heat resistant, requires sealing |
| Marble | $1,000 - $2,500 | Luxurious aesthetic, softer, requires maintenance |
| Porcelain | $800 - $1,600 | Ultra-durable, heat proof, thin profiles possible |
| Solid Timber | $600 - $1,200 | Warm aesthetic, can be re-sanded, needs oiling |
| Stainless Steel | $900 - $1,800 | Commercial look, hygienic, shows scratches |

**Typical kitchen benchtop area:** 4-8m² depending on layout

<Callout type="tip" title="Money-Saving Strategy">
Use premium stone on visible island and backsplash areas, with standard material on less visible sections (under cabinets, laundry nearby).

### 5. Flooring (5-10% of budget)

Kitchen flooring must handle spills, traffic, and cleaning chemicals.

|----------|-------------------------|------|------|

### 6. Sinks, Taps & Accessories (3-5% of budget)

- Structural surprises when removing bulkheads
- Last-minute design refinements

<QuickTip>
For a $50,000 kitchen, maintain $5,000 - $7,500 contingency. If unused, allocate to upgrade selections or treat yourself to that premium appliance you hesitated on.
</QuickTip>

## Three Critical Budget Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Finalising Layout Without Checking Services

Moving a sink 2 metres looks simple on paper but requires:
- New drainage runs (possible concrete cutting)
- Hot/cold water extensions
- Potential floor waste relocation

**Cost impact:** $2,000 - $8,000 if discovered after demolition

**Solution:** Have a plumber inspect existing services before finalising design.

### Mistake 2: Approving Premium Finishes Before Confirming Base Scope

Selecting that stunning marble benchtop before confirming structural works can derail budgets.

**Example:** Client allocates $3,000 for benchtops, selects $8,000 marble, then discovers $5,000 of structural repairs needed.

**Solution:** Lock structural scope and obtain fixed quotes for base works before selecting finishes.

### Mistake 3: Running With No Contingency Buffer

Renovations involve existing conditions you cannot fully inspect until demolition.

**Common surprises:**
- Water damage in kickboards
- Termite damage in framing
- Asbestos in old backing boards
- Outdated wiring requiring full upgrade

**Solution:** Maintain 10-15% contingency. Consider this insurance, not optional.

## When to Invest More

Certain upgrades deliver exceptional value:

**Worth the Premium:**
- **Quality hardware:** Soft-close drawers daily for 10+ years
- **Task lighting:** Under-cabinet LED transforms usability
- **Stone benchtops:** Durability and resale value justify cost
- **Quality tapware:** Daily use item; cheap taps fail quickly

**Consider Carefully:**
- **Statement rangehoods:** Beautiful but functionality matters most
- **Super-premium appliances:** Diminishing returns above mid-premium
- **Exotic stone:** Stunning but requires maintenance

## Getting Accurate Quotes

Use this budget breakdown when requesting quotes:

1. **Specify your budget range:** Builders can suggest appropriate solutions
2. **Request category breakdown:** Compare apples-to-apples between builders
3. **Identify provisional sums:** Understand which costs may vary
4. **Clarify exclusions:** What's not included (appliances, lighting, painting)?

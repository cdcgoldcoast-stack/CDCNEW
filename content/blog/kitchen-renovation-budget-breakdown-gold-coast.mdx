## The Short Answer

A full kitchen renovation on the Gold Coast typically ranges from **$35,000 to $80,000**. The final number depends on size, materials, and how much structural work you need.

But let's break down what that actually means.

## What Drives the Cost?

### Cabinetry (Your Biggest Investment)

This is where quality shows. Good cabinetry lasts 20+ years. Cheap cabinetry shows its age in 5.

- **Entry level:** Laminate doors, standard hardware
- **Mid-range:** Polyurethane or timber veneer, soft-close everything
- **Premium:** Two-pack painted or solid timber, fully custom

### Benchtops: The Statement Piece

Engineered stone (Caesarstone, Quantum Quartz) is the Gold Coast favourite for good reason. It's tough, non-porous, and comes in colours that work with any style.

Natural stone like marble or granite is beautiful but needs more care. Laminate has come a long way and works well for investment properties or tight budgets.

### Appliances: Where You Can Be Smart

You don't need the most expensive oven to cook great meals. A quality mid-range appliance package ($8,000-$15,000) often delivers the best value.

Save your splurge money for:
- A quiet dishwasher (you'll thank yourself every night)
- Good extraction (keeps your kitchen cleaner, longer)
- A cooktop that suits how you actually cook

## Where to Save vs. Splurge

**Worth the investment:**
- Quality hardware (hinges, drawer runners)
- Task lighting (under-cabinet LEDs transform the space)
- A layout that actually works for your family

**Where you can trim:**
- Fancy appliance brands (function over badge)
- Overly complex designs (simple ages better)
- Trendy features you'll tire of

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About

- **Electrical upgrades:** Old kitchens often need new circuits
- **Plumbing moves:** Moving a sink or stove costs more than keeping them put
- **Contingency:** We recommend keeping 10% aside for the unexpected

> **Quick tip:** Keeping your existing layout saves thousands. Sometimes the best kitchen is the same kitchen, just better.

Kitchen budgets are easiest to control when spend is split into categories before design selections begin.

## Typical budget structure

A practical structure looks like this:

- **core construction:** demolition, trade works, compliance
- **cabinetry and joinery:** carcasses, fronts, hardware, install
- **benchtops and finishes:** stone, splashback, paint
- **appliances and fixtures:** cooktop, oven, sink, tapware
- **contingency:** unknowns found during strip-out

## Why category-based budgeting works

Category budgeting creates better decisions because every upgrade has context. Instead of asking "can we afford this?", you can ask "which category absorbs this change?".

## Three budget mistakes to avoid

1. finalizing layout without checking services
2. approving premium finishes before confirming base scope
3. running with no contingency buffer

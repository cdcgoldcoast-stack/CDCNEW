## The Big Picture

Most bathroom renovations take **6 to 8 weeks** from demolition to that first hot shower in your new space. But the journey starts well before the tradies arrive.

## Before We Start: Design & Planning (2-4 weeks)

This is where the magic happens. We'll sit down together and talk about how you actually use your bathroom. Morning rush with kids? Quiet escape after work? The design changes based on your real life.

You'll make decisions on:
- Layout and flow
- Tiles and finishes  
- Fixtures and fittings
- Storage solutions

> **Good to know:** Custom vanities and imported fixtures can take 6-8 weeks to arrive. We plan for this so nothing holds up the build.

## Week 1: Out With the Old

Demo day is oddly satisfying. The old bathroom comes out, and we get our first look at what's underneath. Sometimes we find surprises—old water damage or outdated wiring—but that's exactly why we build contingency into every project.

## Weeks 2-3: The Important Invisible Stuff

Plumbing and electrical rough-in happens now. Walls go back up. And then comes **waterproofing**—the most critical step that nobody sees but everyone depends on. We follow Australian standards to the letter, and we photograph every layer for your peace of mind.

## Weeks 4-5: Where It Starts Looking Real

Tiles go down. Grout goes in. The colour palette you chose starts coming to life. This is when most homeowners start getting excited.

## Week 6: The Finishing Touch

Your vanity, toilet, shower screen, and all those beautiful fixtures get installed. Lighting goes in. We test everything—water pressure, drainage, exhaust fans.

Then we clean. Properly. Your bathroom is ready to use.

## What Can Slow Things Down?

- **Custom orders** (worth the wait, but plan ahead)
- **Hidden surprises** (old homes have stories)
- **Change orders** (deciding mid-build you want a different tile)

The best way to stay on schedule? Make decisions early and trust the process.

## Your Next Step

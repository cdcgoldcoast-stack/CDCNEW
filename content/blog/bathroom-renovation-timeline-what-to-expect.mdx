Bathroom renovations typically take **4 to 6 weeks** from demolition to completion, though complex projects or custom elements can extend this to 8 weeks. Understanding the sequence helps set realistic expectations and ensures you're prepared for each phase.

> **Timeline Variables:** Your specific timeline depends on bathroom size, structural changes, custom elements, and product lead times. This guide covers a standard full bathroom renovation in a typical Gold Coast home.

## Pre-Construction Phase (Weeks 1-2)

Before demolition begins, critical planning ensures the construction phase runs smoothly.

### Design Finalisation

- **Layout confirmation:** Lock in fixture positions, ensuring plumbing efficiency
- **Waterproofing strategy:** Plan for wet area compliance (AS 3740)
- **Material selection:** Choose tiles, fixtures, vanity, and finishes
- **Building approvals:** Submit to certifier if structural changes required

> **Quick Tip:** Order fixtures with long lead times (custom vanities, imported tapware) **8-10 weeks** before demolition. This prevents costly delays mid-project.

### Trade Coordination

Your builder will:

- Finalise trade schedules and sequence
- Confirm material delivery dates
- Set up site protection and waste management
- Establish daily communication protocols

## Week 1: Demolition & Strip-Out

**Duration:** 2-3 days

The existing bathroom is removed completely, including:

- **Safe removal:** Tiles, fixtures, cabinetry, and fittings
- **Plumbing isolation:** Cap services and assess condition
- **Subfloor exposure:** Reveal any hidden damage or waterproofing failures
- **Waste removal:** Responsible disposal of demolition materials

> **Hidden Conditions:** Once tiles are removed, we often discover unexpected issues: timber rot, termite damage, failed waterproofing, or asbestos. A 10-15% contingency in your budget addresses these surprises without stress.

## Week 2: Rough-In & Preparation

**Duration:** 3-5 days

This phase establishes the infrastructure for your new bathroom.

### Structural Updates

- **Framing modifications:** Adjust walls or bulkheads for new layout
- **Subfloor repairs:** Address any rot or damage discovered
- **Nib walls:** Build shower partition walls to correct heights

### Service Rough-Ins

- **Plumbing:** Run new water lines and waste pipes to fixture locations
- **Electrical:** Install wiring for lighting, exhaust fans, heated towel rails, and power points
- **Waterproofing preparation:** Clean and prime surfaces

## Week 3: Waterproofing

**Duration:** 3-4 days (including cure time)

Waterproofing is the most critical phase for long-term bathroom performance. Australian Standard AS 3740 mandates specific requirements:

### Waterproofing Process

1. **Surface preparation:** Clean, repair, and prime all surfaces
2. **Membrane application:** Apply flexible waterproofing membrane to floors and shower walls
3. **Reinforcement:** Embed fabric in corners and joints
4. **Curing:** Allow 24-48 hours for full membrane cure

> **Quality Checkpoint:** Request photos of waterproofing before tiles cover it. Proper application shows continuous membrane up walls to correct heights: 150mm for bathroom floors, 1800mm for shower walls.

## Week 4: Tiling

**Duration:** 5-7 days

Tiling transforms the bathroom aesthetic and requires precision.

### Set-Out (Day 1)

Critical planning before any tiles are fixed:

- **Centre lines:** Establish visual balance for tile layout
- **Grout joint planning:** Minimise small cuts at edges
- **Feature tile placement:** Confirm niche, feature wall, and border positions
- **Falls verification:** Ensure floor slopes correctly to floor waste

### Installation (Days 2-6)

- **Floor tiles first:** Create the foundation
- **Wall tiles:** Work from bottom to top, ensuring level courses
- **Niche and features:** Install recessed shower niches and accent tiles
- **Grouting:** Fill joints with colour-matched grout

> **Quick Tip:** Rectified tiles (sharp edges, minimal grout joints) create a modern, seamless look but require perfectly flat walls. Discuss substrate preparation with your builder if choosing this style.

## Week 5: Fit-Off Begins

**Duration:** 4-5 days

Fixtures and finishes are installed, bringing the design to life.

### Cabinetry & Benchtops

- **Vanity installation:** Secure cabinetry and install benchtop
- **Mirror cabinets:** Mount and connect any integrated lighting
- **Storage solutions:** Install recessed or wall-hung cabinets

### Plumbing Fixtures

- **Toilet:** Connect pan and cistern
- **Vanity basin:** Install basin, tapware, and waste
- **Shower fixtures:** Connect mixer, rail shower, or overhead rose
- **Bath:** Position and connect freestanding or built-in bath

### Electrical Completion

- **Lighting:** Install downlights, pendant lights, and feature lighting
- **Exhaust fan:** Connect and test ventilation
- **Heated towel rail:** Mount and wire (if applicable)
- **Power points:** Install GPOs with appropriate IP ratings

## Week 6: Final Fit-Off & Completion

**Duration:** 3-4 days

The final phase ensures everything works perfectly and looks polished.

### Final Details

- **Shower screen:** Measure, manufacture off-site, then install
- **Accessories:** Towel rails, toilet roll holders, robe hooks
- **Silicone sealing:** All junctions receive quality silicone
- **Mirror installation:** Glue-fixed or framed mirrors positioned

### Testing & Commissioning

- **Water pressure test:** Verify all fixtures operate correctly
- **Leak detection:** Check all connections under pressure
- **Electrical safety:** Test all circuits and RCD protection
- **Exhaust fan airflow:** Confirm adequate ventilation rates

### Practical Completion

- **Professional clean:** Remove all construction dust and debris
- **Final inspection:** Walk through with builder to confirm satisfaction
- **Documentation:** Receive warranties, care instructions, and compliance certificates

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Pre-Construction | 2 weeks | Design, ordering, approvals |
| Demolition | 2-3 days | Strip-out, waste removal |
| Rough-In | 3-5 days | Services, framing |
| Waterproofing | 3-4 days | Membrane, curing |
| Tiling | 5-7 days | Floor, wall, grout |
| Fit-Off | 4-5 days | Cabinetry, fixtures |
| Completion | 3-4 days | Testing, cleaning |

## Factors That Extend Timelines

Several elements can add 1-3 weeks to your project:

- **Custom Joinery:** Custom vanities require 4-6 weeks manufacturing
- **Imported Fixtures:** Specialty tapware can take 8-12 weeks
- **Structural Changes:** Moving walls, adding windows
- **Asbestos Removal:** Requires licensed removalists
- **Concrete Cutting:** Moving drainage in slab homes
- **Complex Tiling:** Herringbone, mosaic features take longer

## How to Keep Your Project on Track

1. **Decide early:** Change orders during construction cause delays
2. **Be available:** Respond quickly to builder questions
3. **Protect the space:** Keep construction zones clear
4. **Plan alternatives:** Arrange alternative bathroom facilities

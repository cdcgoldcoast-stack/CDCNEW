Bathroom projects stay on track when timeline dependencies are handled early. Below is the phase structure we use to keep delivery predictable.

## Phase 1: planning and selections

Key actions:

- finalize layout intent
- confirm waterproofing and compliance scope
- lock fixtures with longer lead times

If you need help clarifying style and materials first, the [renovation design tools](/renovation-design-tools) are a useful starting point.

## Phase 2: demolition and rough-in

This phase includes:

- safe strip-out
- framing updates if required
- plumbing and electrical rough-in

Any hidden conditions are addressed here, which is why contingency planning matters.

## Phase 3: waterproofing, tiling, and set-out

Quality control in this phase is critical for long-term performance. Set-out checks should happen before tile fixing to avoid downstream alignment issues.

## Phase 4: fit-off and completion

Final stage includes:

- fixture installation
- testing and commissioning
- practical completion checks
